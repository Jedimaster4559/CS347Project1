# CS 347 Project 1
This project demonstrates a basic 2D implementation of Ravenfield, a singleplayer FPS with a neat bullet time mechanic. This project also includes a scene that demonstrates how the game can be improved by capping the bullet time feature to have a limited amount of use before needing to recharge.

# Development Environment
- Unity 2019.3.15f1 Personal
- DirectX 11
- Visual Studio 2019 Community (Optional)
